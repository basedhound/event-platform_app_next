- **Node.js** is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code server-side. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is widely used for building scalable network applications, APIs, and servers.

- **TypeScript** is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer productivity. It provides type checking, interfaces, generics, and other advanced features that help catch errors early and improve tooling support.

- **Zod** is a TypeScript-first schema validation library that focuses on developer experience, performance, and robustness. It provides an intuitive API for defining and validating data schemas, ensuring type safety and data integrity in TypeScript projects.

- **Stripe** is a payment processing platform that allows businesses to accept payments online securely and with ease. It provides APIs and tools for managing payment workflows, handling subscriptions, integrating with e-commerce platforms, and ensuring PCI compliance. 

- **React Hook Form** is a lightweight library for managing form state in React applications using hooks. It emphasizes performance, simplicity, and flexibility, making it easy to implement complex forms with minimal boilerplate code.
